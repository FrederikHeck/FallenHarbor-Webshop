# FallenHarbor-Webshop
This is a sample PHP-based webshop, made as a students project. Focus: Login and Shop-Funictionality, static artistic design, JS with Ajax.

The theme of the webshop is a music store for an artist. Design and functionality are not real-world compatible. It's a lovely first attempt of an IT student to get in touch with web-technologies.

The Website is hosted here: https://hafen.uber.space/FallenHarbor/ <\br>
